# this is an example Macros file for teh

any line that doesn't start with a " get's ignored by the parser so you
don't have to preface comments with a #, you can just type them our plainly like this
but I still like prefacing some comments with a # to indicate a section header because
markdown has permanently altered how I look at plain text documents.  if for whatever reason
you do want to leave a comment that starts with a quote, preface it with a blank space, ex:
 "this line will be parsed as a comment"

this file is just an example .teh file that I keep in my ~/.config/ (with less comments)
it is easy to modify to your own needs. If any of your changes don't work, then run
teh --show-macros to see all the macros that are in scope and see any errors when
parsing them

each macro should take one line to it's self, and should start with a single quoted word with
with no whitespace, followed by as much whitespce as you want, then an edit that could also
be passed in to teh as an argument, note you cannot reference another macro in your edits here
because they haven't been parsed yet. Remember you can also override the Target anytime you use
the macro. for ex. if I pipe a paragraph of text into `teh par` teh will add a '(' before the
first character of the paragraph, and ')' after the last character. I could still pipe that same
paragraph in to `teh each par` to wrap each line in a '(' and ')', or `teh only [1,3,5,6] par`
to only parenthesize lines 1,3,5,and 6 of the paragraph

# general text editing macros
## little macros that I find useful mostly anywhere

in for indenting lines by one space
"in"     Each  Ins " " 0

ni for unindenting lines by one space, or delete single line comments
"ni"     Each  Rem 0   1

trm for un-parenthesizing, or un-block commenting, or just to delete the first and last char
"trm"    Whole Rem 0   1  Rem -1   1
"par"    Whole Ins "(" 0  Ins ")" -1
"brck"   Whole Ins "[" 0  Ins "]" -1
"crly"   Whole Ins "{" 0  Ins "}" -1

# language specific comments
## haskell style block and line comments
"hsblk"  Whole Ins "{--\n" 0  Ins "\n--}" -1
"hsln"   Each  Ins "-- " 0

## c style block and line comments
"cblk"   Whole Ins "/*\n" 0  Ins "\n*/" -1
