# teh

Because sed gets clunky and unpleasant for anything more than a find and replace.  Teh is meant to be much simpler to use for common things I wish I knew how to use sed for without googling how to do blank in sed and sifting through so much cruft instead of just getting back to what I was sediting text for anyway

TODO
  conditionally read from stdin
  print errors to stderr
  read list of macros from external text file
